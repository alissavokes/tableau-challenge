The analysis of Citi Bike data was done using the Trip History Logs from each month of 2019. The 12 files were combined into one 2019 data file and loaded into Tableau.

During 2019, many riders preferred not to share their gender or real age. Even so, an overwhelming amount of riders identified as male. Most riders were also between the ages of 25-34. Although most riders were male, their average trip duration was shorter than female riders.

During 2019, the most popular month for Citi Bike rentals was in September. Most riders seem to prefer the warmer weather of the summer and fall months to the colder winter and spring months as the average trip duration peaked in June. There were far less rentals in the winter and the average trip duration for January was about half of June's.
